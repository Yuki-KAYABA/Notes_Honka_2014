# Summary of the Paper

（ひとことメモ）

## Motivation

- This paper focuses on two types of market frictions, namely, consumer search and switching costs
- Quantifying market frictions is important for the following reasons
  - Accounting for consumers' limited information is necessary to recover true consumer preferences
  - Both search and switching costs can increase companies' market power and lead to higher prices for consumers

## Model

### Main Model Assumptions

- The consumer’s search and purchase decisions are conditional on his choice of coverage

- $m = 1, ..., M$ markets (states)
- $j = 1, ..., J$ insurance companies
- $j = 1, ..., J_{m}$ insurance companies within state $m$
- $\Psi_{m}$: the set of available auto insurers in state $m$
