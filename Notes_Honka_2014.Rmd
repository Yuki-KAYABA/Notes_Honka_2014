# Summary of the Paper

（ひとことメモ）

- 


## Motivation

- This paper focuses on two types of market frictions, namely, consumer search and switching costs
- Quantifying market frictions is important for the following reasons
  - Accounting for consumers' limited information is necessary to recover true consumer preferences
  - Both search and switching costs can increase companies' market power and lead to higher prices for consumers

## Model

### Main Model Assumptions

- The consumer’s search and purchase decisions are conditional on his choice of coverage
- Consumers search to resolve uncertainty about prices
- Consumers use a simultaneous search approach

### Model Development

**Notations**

- $i = 1, ..., N$ consumers
- $m = 1, ..., M$ markets (states)
- $j = 1, ..., J$ insurance companies
- $j = 1, ..., J_{m}$ insurance companies within state $m$
- $\Psi_{m}$: the set of available auto insurers in state $m$
- $c_{i}$: consumer search costs
- $k$: the number of searches that a consumer conducts
- $S_{i}$: the set of companies that a consumer searches
- $\overline{S_{i}}$: the set of companies that a consumer does not search
- $j_{I_{ij, t-1}}$: the previous insurer
- $C_{i} = S_{i} \cup \{ j_{I_{ij, t-1}} \}$: the consumer's consideration set
- $\Psi_{m} = C_{i} \cup \overline{S_{i}}$

**Indirect Utility**

Consumer $i$'s indirect utility for company $j$ is given by:
    
$$
u_{ij} = \alpha_{ij} + \beta_{i} I_{ij, t-1} + \gamma p_{ij} + X_{ij}\rho + W_{i} \phi + \epsilon_{ij}
$$
    
where $\beta_{i} = \tilde{\beta} + Z_{i} \kappa$.

- $\epsilon_{ij}$ captures a component of the utility that is observed by the consumer, but not the researcher
- $\epsilon_{ij}$ follows an EV Type I distribution with location parameter 0 and scale parameter 1
- $\alpha_{ij}$ are consumer-specific brand intercepts
- Let $\alpha = (\alpha_{1}, ..., \alpha_{J})$ and assume that $\alpha$ follows a MVN distribution with mean $\overline{\alpha}$ and covariance matrix $\Sigma_{\alpha}$
- $\beta_{i}$ captures consumer inertia
- $I_{ij, t-1}$ is a dummy variable indicating whether company $j$ is consumer $i$'s previous insurer
- $Z_{i}$ contains demographic factors, psychographic factors, and customer satisfaction with the previous insurer
- Inertia $\beta_{i}$ is divided into two parts (to separately evaluate its effects in counterfactuals):
  - **customer switching costs**: the constant $\tilde{\beta}$, demographic factors, and psychographic factors
  - **customer satisfaction**: customer satisfaction
- $\gamma$ captures price sensitivity
- $p_{ij}$ denotes the price charged by company $j$
- Assume prices $p_{ij}$ follows as EV Type I distribution with location parameter $\eta_{ij}$ and scale parameter $\mu$ [^1]
- $X_{ij}$ is a vector of product- and consumer-specific attributes
- $W_{i}$ contaions demographic factors, psychographic factors, and regional fixed effects that are common across $j$

**EIU (Expected Indirect Utility)**

- Assume that consumers know all company characteristics except for prices (searching for prices is costly)
- Consumers do not search their previous insurer as insurance companies automatically send their customers renewal notices and thus consumers receive a free quote from their previous insurer ("fall-back option")
- Before collecting price information, consumers have to decide which companies to search
- Following Chade and Smith (2005), assume that first order stochastic dominance among the price belief distributions and use the optimal selection strategy
- The consumer makes the decisions of which and how many companies to search at the same time
- Consumer $i$'s expected indirect utility (EIU) is given by:

$$
E[u_{ij}] = \alpha_{ij} + \beta_{i} I_{ij, t-1} + \gamma E[p_{ij}] + X_{ij}\rho + W_{i} \phi + \epsilon_{ij}
$$

- Consumer $i$ ranks all companies other than his previous insurance provider according to their EIUs and then picks the top $k$ companies to search
- $R_{ik}$ denotes the set of top $k$ companies consumer $i$ ranks highest according to their EIU
- To decide on the number of companies $k$, the consumer calculates the net benefit of all possible search sets _given the ranking of EIUs_
- A consumer's benefit of a searched set is then given by the expected _maximum_ utility among the searched brands
- Given the EV distribution of prices, the maximum utility has also an EV distribution:

$$
\max_{j \in R_{ik}} u_{ij} \sim EV(\frac{1}{b} \ln \sum_{j \in R_{ik}} \exp(ba_{ij}), b)
$$

with $a_{ij} = \alpha_{ij} + \beta_{i} I_{ij, t-1} + \gamma \eta_{ij} + X_{ij}\rho + W_{i} \phi + \epsilon_{ij}$ and $b = \frac{\mu}{\gamma}$.

- The benefit of a searched set is given by

$$
E[\max_{j \in R_{ik}} u_{ij}] = \tilde{a}_{R_{ik}} + \frac{e_{c}}{b}
$$

where $\tilde{a}_{R_{ik}} = \frac{1}{b} \ln \sum_{j \in R_{ik}} \exp(ba_{ij})$ and $e_{c}$ is the Euler constant

- The consumer picks $S_{ik}$ which maximizes his net benefit of searching denoted $\Gamma_{i, k+1}$, i.e. the expected utility among the considered companies minus the cost of search:

$$
\Gamma_{i, k+1} = E \left[ \max_{j \in R_{ik} \cup \left\{j_{I_{ij, t-1}} \right\}} u_{ij} \right] - kc_{i}
$$

- The consumer picks the number of searches $k$ which maximizes his net benefit of search
- The consumer then picks the company with the highest utility among the considered companies:

$$
j = \mathop{\rm argmax}\limits_{\boldsymbol{j \in C_{i}}} u_{ij}
$$
